    "In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance.\n",

    "### SCOPING\n",
    "\n",
    "Project scoping creates a structure for the entire project. This includes stating the goals for the project, gathering the data, considering the analytical steps required through analysis and evaluation which will help build conclusions and findings from the analysis. A proper project scope can be a great road map for any project. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PROJECT GOALS\n",
    "\n",
    "The project goal is to utilize the machine learning skills and its techniques to the OKCupid App User Profile dataset. Zodiac symbols are important for many users, but some users don’t add them in. This project will classify Zodiac signs using drinking, smoking, drugs, and essays as the features and will predict a user’s zodiac signs so we can guess the missing zodiacs when we make matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is stored in profiles.csv provided by codecademy. The dataset provided has the following columns of multiple-choice data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: continuous variable of users age \n",
    "- body_type: categorical variable of body type of user\n",
    "- diet: categorical variable of dietary information\n",
    "- drinks: categorical variable of alcohol consumption\n",
    "- drugs: categorical variable of drug usage\n",
    "- education: categorical variable of educational attainment\n",
    "- ethnicity: categorical variable of ethnic backgrounds\n",
    "- height: continuous variable of height of user\n",
    "- income: continuous variable of income of user\n",
    "- job: categorical variable of employment description\n",
    "- offspring: categorical variable of children status\n",
    "- orientation: categorical variable of sexual orientation\n",
    "- pets: categorical variable of pet preferences\n",
    "- religion: categorical variable of religious background\n",
    "- sex: categorical variable of gender\n",
    "- sign: categorical variable of astrological symbol\n",
    "- smokes: categorical variable of smoking consumption\n",
    "- speaks: categorical variable of language spoken\n",
    "- status: categorical variable of relationship status\n",
    "- last_online: date variable of last login\n",

    "#### ANALYSIS\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data is received, summary statistics, descriptive statistics like mean, median, range, correlations,Data visualizations for univariate and multivariate exploration and short summary notes explaining insights gained from exploration. Since zodiac signs are being classified to make predictions on missing zodiac signs, machine learning classification algorithms will be implemented to solve the problem of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EVALUATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is created, metrics of success are used to evaluate the model performance(s). This include the use of confusion matrix and finding the accuracy, precision, recall, f1 of the model(s) used, and create graphs showing how they changed. The main components to include in the machine learning evaluation are:\n",
